# What is Version Control?

## What is Git 1/2

- Git is a software designed to track the **entire** history of the code of a project. 

- Main appeal: facilitates full reproducibility and collaboration. 

- Designed originally for software development, it has gained important traction in the research community. 

- With GUIs (GitHub Desktop) the learning curve decreased and benefits started to exceed the costs. 

**G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface   

## What is Git 2/2

- By code git understands any type of plain text file (`myfile.R`, `myfile.do`, `.tex/.md/.txt/.csv/.etc`).

- Files that are "non-human readable" are called binary files (`myfile.docx`, `myfile.xlxs`, `.pdf/.exe/.dta/.etc`).

- Git can also detect changes in binary files, but it cannot show those changes.

## What is Github

  Github is a company that provides two services (that we care of): 
  
- A web hosting service for all our files track with git (public free/private $ or free if academic).  
- A GUI software (Desktop App) that provides user friendly access to git.

## Goal

**Goal 1:** Keep track of any potentially meaningful modification to your code.  

**Goal 2:** Learn how to collaborate with others using Github.   

## Conventional Method:  

1 - Agree on a naming convention with you co-authors (eg: YYYYMMDDfilename_INITALS).  
2 - Begin working from the last saved version (eg: `20180325demo_FH.do`).  
3 - At the end of the day, save on a new version (eg: `20180327demo_FH.do`).  

**Pros:** Easy adoption.   

**Cons:** Lots of files for each document, hard to see changes of your own and others, hard to track the time of changes, errors and time costs.     
  
## Github:  

1 - Name your file `filename` (ideally `01_filename`).
2 - Takes a snapshot of your work every time you complete relevant change. 
3 - Updates your entire working folder in the cloud.   

**Pros:** One file per document, track differences across all versions, easily follow when others make a change, works with the cloud. 

**Cons:** Harder adoption.   

## We want to avoid this situation:

## Other reasons to use git

To access a whole new world of knowledge!  

- Collaborate in others' open access projects (e.g. R packages). 
- Find collaborators for your own projects. 

# Demos

## Three Demos: 

1 - **Work on a solo project.**   

2 - Copy and work on another person's project. 
 
3 - Collaborate with other people in a project.    


## Demo #1: We Start in the Cloud 

1-  Create [github.com](github.com) account and sign in.   
2-  Let's look at some **repos**.   
3-  First way to access content: download.   
4-  What if you want to have your own copy of the repo? **Fork** it!.  
5-  Now create your own repo. Initiate readme and make some edits.   

## Demo #1: We move to our local computer 

6- Clone the it. Explore the files and location.   
7- Create new files, edit. And commit. Edit again, and commit again.   
8- Push. Edit on github.com, and pull.   
9- Simulate conflict (between local and remote) and start from a fresh copy!
10- For this tutorial, best way to access previous version: explore in github.com and download.


## Three Demos: 

1 - Simple but instructive.   
    *Review: def repo, github.com, download, clone, destination folder, fork, create repo, commit, push, pull, delete & restart, search repo, download old version.*   
2 - **Repeat but with a slightly more fun example. Collaborate.**
    
3 - Repeat with a real-life example.   
    
    
## Demo #2: Branches and collaboration

1- Create a branch from previus repo.  
2- Add new content, commit a few times and merge.  
3- Go back to main branch (master), observe file, merge.  
4- Repeat 1-3 but now replace instead of adding content.    
 

## Demo #2: Branches and collaboration 

5- Fork repo `github.com/BITSS/test2`, and clone it into your machine.  
6- Edit fields of name, and birth date.   
7- Save, commit and push.   
8- Create your first Pull Request.   
9- Let's see if I can manage all those pull requests very quickly.     
10- Create a new repo, invite a collaborator, edit, commit, push/pull.

## Three Demos: 

1 - Simple but instructive.   
    Review: def repo, github.com, download, clone, destination folder, fork, create repo, commit, push, pull, delete & restart, search repo, download old version.   
2 - Repeat but with a slightly more fun example. Collaborate.
    *Review: All of the above, plus: branch, merge, resolve conflicts, collaborate: same proj, fork model+PR*
    .  
3 - **Repeat with a real-life example.**   
    
## Demo #3: Look inside a half-way project (and collaborate!)

Description:   

- Half baked project, forgoten from a few years.    
- Exploratory analysis of publication trends in NBER working paper series. Back then inspired by a paper from [DelaVigna and Card](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~sdellavi/wp/CardDellaVignaTop5PapersJEL2013.pdf).  
- Now there is more literature around this: [Chari and Goldsmith-Pinkham](http://www.nber.org/papers/w23953).   

- I will use github to share my work with you, do a little excercise, and invite you to collaborate. 
    
## Demo #3: Look inside a half-way project (and collaborate!)

1-  Find the following repo: `github.com/fhoces/nber_trends`.   
2-  Fork it and clone it.    
3-  Open it in your computer, look around and try to execute some parts.  
4-  Generate random number like this: `num1 = sample(20000, 1)`.  
5-  Look the name and (imputed) gender of the author in row `num1`.  
6-  Create the following line at the end of the script: `verification = (num1, author, gender, correct(1 yes, 0 no) )`.  
7-  Save, commit, push and create a pull request.  
8-  Feel free to look around create more contributions if you like. Happy to co-author.

    .  
3 - Repeat with a real-life example.  
    *Review: All of the above, plus: how does a real-life example looks like.* 
    
## Now go and explore!
Some good habits:   
- Commit often (<1hr)  
- Always pull before you start a new session of work. Also good to pull before pushing.    
- Think of your remote as the most important set of files. Get used to deleting things in your local machine.
